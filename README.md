# Health_Premium_Prediction
This project presents a Health Insurance Cost Prediction Web Application that utilizes machine learning to estimate medical insurance charges based on individual user inputs. The system is developed using Python and Flask for the backend and integrates a trained regression model that predicts costs using features such as age, BMI, number of children, gender, smoking status, and region.
